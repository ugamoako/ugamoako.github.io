name
They do not!
They do to!
I hope so.
She okay?
Let's go.
Wow
Okay you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
No
I'm kidding. You know how sometimes you just become this persona? And you don't know how to quit?
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
The real you.
What good stuff?
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
Thank God! If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure
Me. This endless blonde babble. I'm like boring myself.
What crap?
do you listen to this crap?
No
Then Guillermo says If you go any lighter you're gonna look like an extra on 90210.
You always been this selfish?
But
Then that's all you had to say.
Well no
You never wanted to go out with 'me did you?
I was?
I looked for you back at the party but you always seemed to be occupied.
Tons
Have fun tonight?
I believe we share an art instructor
You know Chastity?
Looks like things worked out tonight huh?
Hi.
Who knows? All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Lesbian? No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring samesex tendencies.
She's not a
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
I really really really wanna go but I can't. Not unless my sister goes.
Sure have.
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
How do you get your hair to look like that?
You're sweet.
You have my word. As a gentleman
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You got something on your mind?
Where?
There.
Well there's someone I think might be
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Forget French.
That's because it's such a nice one.
I don't want to know how to say that though. I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are. How much does champagne cost? Stuff like Chat. I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
Right. See? You're ready for the quiz.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Let me see what I can do.
Gosh if only we could find Kat a boyfriend
That's a shame.
Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Why?
Seems like she could get a date easy enough
The thing is Cameron I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. I can't date until she does.
Cameron.
No no it's my fault we didn't have a proper introduction
Forget it.
You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
Okay then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine. Saturday? Night?
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please.
Well I thought we'd start with pronunciation if that's okay with you.
Can we make this quick? Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break up on the quad. Again.
I did.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
All I know is I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with you know?
Bianca I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include dooropening and coatholding.
Combination. I don't know I thought he'd be different. More of a gentleman
Is he oily or dry?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Would you mind getting me a drink Cameron?
Great
Joey.
Who?
Where did he go? He was just here.
You might wanna think about it
No.
Did you change your hair?
You know the deal. I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go
Listen I want to talk to you about the prom.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Hi Joey.
Hey sweet cheeks.
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Neat
It's a gay cruise line but I'll be like wearing a uniform and stuff.
Queen Harry?
So yeah I've got the Sears catalog thing going and the tube sock gig that's gonna be huge. And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Hopefully.
Exactly So you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Expensive?
It's more
Perm?
Patrick is that a.
It's just you.
Is that woman a complete fruitloop or is it just me?
No! I just wanted
What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What?
I just wanted
You set me up.
Let go!
So did you
You looked beautiful last night you know.
I guess I'll never know will I?
Not all experiences are good Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
God you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark so I can't experience anything for myself
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
That's not
No. you didn't! If you really thought I could make my own decisions you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
Why didn't you tell me?
After that I swore I'd never do anything just because everyone else was doing it. And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party and my stunning gastrointestinal display
But
Just once. Afterwards I told him I didn't want to anymore. I wasn't ready. He got pissed. Then he broke up with me.
You did what?
He said everyone was doing it. So I did it.
As in
Now I do. Back then was a different story.
But you hate Joey
He was like a total babe
Why?
In 9th. For a month
What?
Joey never told you we went out did he?
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go because you won ' t.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons not someone else ' s .
Like you care.
Listen I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
You're welcome.
I don't get you. You act like you're too good for any of this and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
Bianca I need to talk to you I need to tell you
Can we go now?
You are so completely unbalanced.
Yeah he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend. I guess since I'm not allowed to go out I should obsess over a dead guy too.
It's Shakespeare. Maybe you've heard of him?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
At least I'm not a clouted fen sucked hedgepig.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
What's normal?
You're ruining my life' Because you won't be normal I can't be normal.
I think you're a freak. I think you do this to torture me. And I think you suck.
What do you think?
Oh I thought you might have a date I don't know why I'm bothering to ask but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh my God does this mean you're becoming normal?
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Nowhere Hi Daddy.
Where've you been?
I have a date Daddy. And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
I'm missing something.
Fine. I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house. I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
You're not going unless your sister goes. End of story.
He's not a hot rod. Whatever that is.
It's that hot rod Joey right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
No but
The prom? Kat has a date?
Daddy I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night
Because she'll scare them away.
Why?
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Just for a minute
Daddy no!
Wear the belly before you go.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Oh God. It's starting.
If Kat's not going you're not going.
Daddy people expect me to be there!
It's just a party. Daddy but I knew you'd forbid me to go since Gloria Steinem over there isn't going
Otherwise known as an orgy?
If you must know we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
And where're you going?
Daddy I
Exactly my point
But she doesn't want to date.
But it's not fair she's a mutant Daddy!
Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
What if she never starts dating?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.
Now don't get upset. Daddy but there's this boy and I think he might ask
Just sent 'em through.
Padua girls. One tall decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Never
